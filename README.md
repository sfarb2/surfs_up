# Surf's Up

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to evaluate temperature trends in Oahu in June and December to determine whether an ice cream and surf shop would be a sustainable endeavor year-round.

## Results
- Perhaps the main takeaway is that the weather in Oahu is gorgeous. Assuming that June represents among the hottest temperatures and December the coldest, the full range in those months is a grand total of 30 degrees Fahrenheit (56 to 85).

### June
- In 1,700 June measurements, the temperature never climbed above 85 nor dropped below 64 degrees. With an average hovering right at 75 and a full 50% of the temperature readings between 73 and 77 degrees, it's hard to imagine more perfect ice cream and surfing weather.

### December
- In wonderful news for our business plan, the weather in December is barely any colder. More than 1,500 data points were collected and though the low temperature did drop into the mid 50s, the average was still over 71 degrees and 50% of recorded temperatures were between 69 and 74 degrees.

## Summary
Based on temperature alone, Oahu is a great place to open a combination surf and ice cream shop. Our data showed that it never gets too cold or too hot there, and the temperature is not particularly volatile so a consistent stream of customers can be expected.

### Additional Evaluations
- Beyond temperature, the most important weather trend to examine is precipitation. Though we've established that Oahu is quite temperate, a rainy season could put a serious damper in our projections. We need to ensure that the rain is relatively predictable and tolerable.

- Queries we use to dig into precipitation data should examine, among other things:
  * frequency with which rain occurs (both overall and by month/time of year)
  * volume of precipitation that falls (can we expect brief showers or sustained downpours?)
